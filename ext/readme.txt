I took  /ext/tk/sample/tkballonhelp.rb from Hidetoshi NAGAI (nagai@ai.kyutech.ac.jp) and modified it. A copy of the original file is tkballoonhelp_ORIGINAL.rb. As far as I know, licence is Ruby's licence. Newer version of this file are available here: http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/branches/ruby_1_9_3/ext/tk/sample/
